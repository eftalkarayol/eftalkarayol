## About Me

ðŸš€ As a React Native Developer, I possess extensive knowledge and experience in state management using Redux, Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Context API, MobX, and Recoil. I ensure code quality through adherence to Clean Code principles and utilize SonarQube for regular analysis. In terms of testing and distribution, I am proficient in utilizing BrowserStack, TestFlight, App Distribution, and App Center to ensure seamless deployment of applications. For notification and messaging services, I have integrated OneSignal, UseInsider, Socket.IO, SmartMessage, and Firebase into applications to provide real-time communication capabilities. In terms of styling, I leverage Tailwind CSS, NativeWind, and StyleSheet to create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces. Furthermore, I focus on performance optimization techniques to ensure efficient application development and utilize memorization techniques to enhance overall performance.
